# Zentrip Java

This is a copy of the Zentrip Flutter app with the same assets and visual UI, paired with a Java Spring Boot backend in `backend/`.

## Java toolchain

Use JDK 25 or newer to run the backend and Android Gradle build. The Android app continues to compile Java and Kotlin to Java 17 bytecode; its Gradle wrapper is pinned to 9.1.0 for Java 25 runtime support.

## Run the backend

Configure `DB_URL`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `SERPAPI_KEY` as described in [backend/README.md](backend/README.md), then run `mvn spring-boot:run` from `backend/`.

## Run Flutter

From this project root, run:

```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

The copied app targets the Java API at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api`. The original Laravel project is not modified.# zentrip

## Admin dashboard

The Flutter app includes a responsive, Arabic/English admin dashboard with live customer, reservation, and booked-value summaries. Admin endpoints verify the account role on every request; customer accounts remain the default.

To grant the first admin role, create the intended account, then start the backend with `APP_ADMIN_EMAIL` set to that existing account's exact email. The backend promotes only that account at startup. Alternatively, a database administrator can promote an existing account directly with `UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';`. Never expose admin promotion through a public endpoint.# zentrip
